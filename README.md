# Deep_Learning_Specialization_Programming_Exercises
These Programming Exercises are part of the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. It's a great course and I would highly recommend it for people who are interested in learning deep learning.<br>
**The Deep Learning Specialization Consists of 5 courses, divided into multiple weeks as shown below.**

# Course1 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
## W2A2 - Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
**Objective:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

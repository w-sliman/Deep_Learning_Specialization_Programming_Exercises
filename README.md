# Deep_Learning_Specialization_Programming_Exercises
These Programming Exercises are part of the deeplearning.ai Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. It's a great course and I would highly recommend it for people who are interested in learning deep learning.<br>
**The Deep Learning Specialization Consists of 5 courses, divided into multiple weeks as shown below.**

# Course1 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
## Week2
### [W2A2 - Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/w-sliman/Deep_Learning_Specialization_Programming_Exercises/blob/main/Course%201%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Week2/W2A2/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb)
**Objective:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
## Week3
### W3A1 - Planar data classification with one hidden layer
**Objective:**
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Compute the cross entropy loss
- Implement forward and backward propagation
## Week4
### W4A1 - Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
**Objective:**
- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class

### W4A2 - Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application
**Objective:**
- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning

# Course2 - LLLLL
